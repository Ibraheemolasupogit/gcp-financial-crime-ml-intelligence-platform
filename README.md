# GCP Financial Crime ML Intelligence Platform

A local-first, GCP-aligned machine learning intelligence platform for synthetic financial crime analytics, covering fraud detection, AML risk scoring, anomaly detection, graph risk, NLP alert triage, monitoring, governance evidence, and cloud architecture design.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to detect suspicious behaviour across customers, accounts, transactions, beneficiaries, devices, alerts, and case narratives. Financial crime teams must prioritise noisy alert queues, identify emerging typologies, explain risk decisions, monitor model behaviour, and retain evidence for governance and audit review.

This repository demonstrates those engineering patterns using synthetic data only. It is designed for public portfolio review and does not contain real customer data, credentials, secrets, production infrastructure, or live financial crime intelligence.

## Why This Project Matters

Financial crime ML systems need more than a classifier. They need governed data ingestion, deterministic feature engineering, transparent scoring, unsupervised risk discovery, network analysis, text triage, monitoring, auditability, and human review controls. This project shows how those components fit together in a practical local implementation while mapping clearly to a future GCP production architecture.

## Key Capabilities

- Deterministic synthetic financial crime data generation
- Data ingestion, schema validation, relationship checks, and data quality reporting
- Transaction, velocity, customer, account, beneficiary, device, and typology features
- Supervised fraud classification baseline using scikit-learn
- Transparent AML risk scoring and prioritised alert generation
- Isolation Forest anomaly detection with reason codes
- NetworkX graph and network risk modelling
- Lightweight NLP alert triage and synthetic case-note classification
- Drift, prediction, risk distribution, and alert quality monitoring
- Governance evidence pack, model risk assessment, audit log, and lifecycle traceability
- GCP reference architecture, deployment blueprint, operations runbook, and service mapping

## Architecture Overview

The local workflow is organised as a synthetic ML lifecycle:

```text
synthetic data -> validation -> features -> models and scoring -> risk outputs -> monitoring -> governance evidence -> GCP blueprint
```

The platform is intentionally batch-oriented and local-first. Each stage writes explicit artifacts under `data/processed/`, `outputs/sample/`, or `reports/sample/`, making the workflow easy to inspect and reproduce.

If your environment uses `python3` rather than `python`, run the equivalent `python3` commands.

## End-to-End Demo

Run the full local workflow:

```bash
bash scripts/run_all_local.sh
```

Or run each stage manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_demo_data.py
python3 scripts/validate_demo_data.py
python3 scripts/build_features.py
python3 scripts/train_fraud_model.py
python3 scripts/run_anomaly_detection.py

python3 scripts/run_nlp_triage.py
python3 scripts/run_monitoring.py
python3 scripts/generate_governance_pack.py
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py

```

Equivalent CLI commands are available:

```bash
python3 -m financial_crime_ml.cli generate-data
python3 -m financial_crime_ml.cli validate-data
python3 -m financial_crime_ml.cli build-features
python3 -m financial_crime_ml.cli train-fraud-model

## Portfolio Positioning

This project demonstrates financial crime ML engineering, scalable pipeline design, transparent scoring, monitoring, model governance, and GCP-aligned production thinking. It is intended to show practical Python engineering across the full synthetic ML lifecycle rather than a narrow notebook-only model exercise.

## Synthetic Data Disclaimer

All datasets and outputs are synthetic demonstration artifacts. They must not be interpreted as real customer behaviour, real alerts, real typologies, real financial crime intelligence, or production model evidence.

## Non-Production Disclaimer

This repository is not production deployment. It does not create cloud infrastructure, service accounts, credentials, APIs, BigQuery tables, Pub/Sub topics, Dataflow jobs, Vertex AI pipelines, dashboards, model registry integrations, or live monitoring services.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data cannot represent the full complexity of real financial crime behaviour.
- Model metrics are demonstration metrics and not evidence of production suitability.
- Rule-based AML, network, and NLP logic is intentionally transparent and lightweight.
- Monitoring is local and file-based, not a live operational service.
- GCP alignment is documented as architecture and deployment planning only.
- Human investigation, validation, governance approval, and compliance review would be required before any production use.

## Future Enhancements

- Infrastructure-as-code examples in a separate, non-credentialed deployment milestone
- Containerised batch workflow packaging
- BigQuery SQL feature engineering examples
- Vertex AI training pipeline prototype
- Looker Studio-ready reporting layer
- Investigator feedback loop design
- Model registry and approval workflow integration
- Expanded fairness, explainability, and typology evaluation documentation
